          <h3 class="about__title">This is me...</h3>
          <p>
            ...born in Bavaria, I've lived in several
            different countries (Austria, Chile, USA, UK,
            Netherlands, and Mexico) before coming to
            Berlin. My experience is in a variety of
            industries and roles, where I've had the
            opportunity to develop my skills in problem
            solving, working as part of a team and
            analytical skills. For example in my role as
            Office Manager at a start-up, I was used to
            figuring out pain points and how to solve them
            quickly, often in creative ways. I've worked
            with a variety of cultures, which allowed me to
            learn how to communicate effectively and without
            fear.
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm transitioning to software development
            because this is where I know I can make an even
            bigger impact, being solution focused and
            enjoying connecting dots and people.
            <br />

              alt="a photo of Franziska and her dog 'Lotti'"
            />
            <br />

            When I'm not immersed in the coding world I
            enjoy baking (especially cakes and bread), going
            on walks with my dog "Lotti" especially anywhere
            that's near water and planning for my next big
            project "Establishing my own farm in Spain" (I'm
            happy to tell you more in person).

                efficient way of doing things. Everyone
                makes mistakes, owning them and learning
                from them is how I grow.

                Working as a team is how we can create
                synergies and momentum to overcome
                obstacles. However, being part of a team
                also means both to be able to work
                independently and carry my own weight and to
                ask for help when I'm stuck.
